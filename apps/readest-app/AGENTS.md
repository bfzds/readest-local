## Project Overview

Readest is a cross-platform ebook reader built as a **Next.js 16 + Tauri v2** app. It's part of a pnpm monorepo at `/apps/readest-app/`. The app runs on desktop (macOS/Windows/Linux via Tauri).

### 目标平台与优化边界（Target Platform & Optimization Boundary）

本项目主要应用场景为**桌面端**（Tauri：macOS/Windows/Linux）。所有功能、性能与内存优化工作**一律聚焦桌面端**，**web 端不作为优化目标**：

- web 端专属的性能/内存优化建议（如 blob URL 生命周期管理、封面 URL 惰性化、浏览器端备份流式化等）**不采纳、不实施**。
- 评估任何改动收益时，以桌面端真实场景（本地书籍库、离线阅读、章节解析、词典加载、备份导出）为基准，而非浏览器场景。
- 桌面端与 web 端共享的改动（如 zip 解压 worker、章节 LRU、SVG 节点合并）允许实施，但其收益论证必须立足桌面端。

### Path Aliases (tsconfig)

- `@/*` → `./src/*`
- `@/components/ui/*` → `./src/components/primitives/*`

### Rust Backend (`src-tauri/`)

Platform-specific code lives in `src-tauri/src/{macos,windows,linux}/`. Custom Tauri plugins are in `src-tauri/plugins/`.

## Git Worktrees

Always use `pnpm worktree:new <branch-name|pr-number>` to create worktrees. Never use `git worktree add` directly — the script handles submodule initialization (simplecc WASM, foliate-js), dependency installation, `.env` copying, vendor assets, and Tauri gen symlinks that are required for lint and tests to pass.

```bash
pnpm worktree:new feat/my-feature   # New branch from origin/main
pnpm worktree:new 3837              # Checkout PR #3837 with push access to fork
```

## Agent Workspace

Project-related agent context lives under `.agents/`, which is a symlink to `.claude/`. Treat `.agents/` as the canonical path when looking for or updating local agent material:

- `.agents/memory/` — persistent project memory and recurring context
- `.agents/plans/` — active or archived implementation plans
- `.agents/rules/` — project rules for test-first work, TypeScript, verification, and related workflows

> On Windows checkouts without `core.symlinks=true`, `.agents/{memory,plans,rules}` are checked out as plain text files containing the relative target path (e.g. `../.claude/rules`) and the real content lives only under `.claude/`. Verify with `Get-Item .agents` before assuming the link exists; when the link is broken, use `.claude/` paths.

## Project Rules

Rules are in `.agents/rules/`: test-first, typescript, verification.

### Implementation Scope

For every coding task, write the minimum code that solves the requested problem.

- Do not add features beyond what was asked.
- Do not add abstractions for single-use code.
- Do not add flexibility or configurability unless requested.
- Do not add error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If a solution is much longer than necessary, simplify it before finishing.
- Before shipping, ask: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### i18n

See [docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md) for the key-as-content translation approach, `stubTranslation` usage in non-React modules, and extraction workflow.

### Safe Area Insets

See [docs/safe-area-insets.md](docs/safe-area-insets.md) for rules on handling top/bottom insets for UI elements near screen edges.

### Read Aloud

Four engines sit behind `TTSClient`, including recorded-narration playback from EPUB 3 Media Overlays (a Kindle Immersion Reading equivalent). Gate behaviour on `TTSCapabilities`, never on client identity. See [docs/read-along-narration.md](docs/read-along-narration.md).

### Design System

UI/UX rules — surface tiers, action vocabulary, settings primitives (`BoxedList`, `SettingsRow`, `SettingsSwitchRow`, `SettingsSelect`, `NavigationRow`, `Tips`, etc.), boxed-list anatomy, RTL conventions, e-ink overlay, and anti-patterns — live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md). Codify recurring decisions there so they persist for the team and future contributors. Reach for the primitives in `src/components/settings/primitives/` instead of inlining chassis classes.

### E-ink mode

Every new UI widget must look right under `[data-eink='true']`. E-ink screens have no shadows, no gradients, slow refresh, and need crisp 1px borders for delineation. The conventions live in `src/styles/globals.css` — reuse the existing classes instead of inventing new ones:

- **Surfaces / inputs** — add `eink-bordered`. In eink mode it swaps to `bg-base-100` + 1px `base-content` border. Use it on inputs, custom button backgrounds, ghost-styled cancel buttons, and any container that needs a visible boundary.
- **Primary action buttons** — use `btn-contrast` (theme-neutral solid, already e-ink-correct) for most primary actions; reserve `btn-primary` for true call-to-action buttons. The `[data-eink]` rules render both as `base-content` bg + `base-100` text so the primary action stays distinct from secondary actions.
- **`.modal-box`** picks up no-shadow + 1px border automatically; dialogs that use it don't need additions.
- **Don't rely on color/shadow alone for hierarchy.** Two same-tone buttons differ only by hover on color themes, and hover doesn't exist on e-ink touchscreens. Pair a borderless ghost (cancel) with a solid CTA (submit) so eink can invert one without flattening the difference.

When in doubt, toggle E-ink in Settings → Misc and check. The rules in `globals.css` cover most cases automatically, but composite components (custom buttons, layered cards) often need `eink-bordered` on the right element to stay legible.
